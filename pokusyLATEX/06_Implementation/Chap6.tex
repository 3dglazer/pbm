\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Volume representation}
both unified grid and procedural volume (multiple octaves of perlin noise)

I have decided to implement it using pbrt. what is pbrt what structures I will use, which I have to create.

\section{Ground truth}
light tracer - dual algorithm to path tracer. It is able to capture caustic effects. Maybe path tracer too??

\myFigure{14}{images/rr_sampling.png}{Energy contribution of phase functions, inverse squared distance and both samples on ray lights.}{Different functions have been evaluated in discreet point pairs (from 0 to 1 parametric range) on two randomly placed rays.\\ On the left image only contribution using ray moderately forward scattering (g=0.75) Heney-Greenstein phase functions has been evaluated. In the middle inverse squared contribution and on the right contribution using both phase function and inverse sqared distance.}

V tehle kapitole muzu i ukazat ty veci z matlabu ze funguji a jak.
Klidne popsat, i postup implemntace pres jednoduzsi az po slozitejsi metody.
