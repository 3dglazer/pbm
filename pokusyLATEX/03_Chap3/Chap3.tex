\chapter{Common solutions}
In this chapter we will try to summarize the most common technics for solving the rendering equation in the presence of participating media.

\section{ Rasterization}
Still most used in films and games - fast approximation.
Particle rasterization + rendering slices of 3D volumes can solve only direct illumination.
\section{Raytracing}
\subsection{Unbiased methods}
Plus and cons
\subsection{Biased methods}
irradiance caching, Photon tracing, final gather ...
Plus and cons
