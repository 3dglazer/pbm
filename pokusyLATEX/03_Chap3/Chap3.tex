\chapter{Common solutions}
In this chapter we will try to summarize the most common technics for solving the rendering equation in the presence of participating media.

\section{ Rasterization}
Films -

Still most used in films and games - fast approximation.
Particle rasterization + rendering slices of 3D volumes can solve only direct illumination.
\section{Raytracing}
\subsection{Raymarching volumes}
More recently, another technique has become popular for sampling distances along a ray in an inhomogeneous medium. The idea comes from the neutron transport community in the 60s and has various names (delta tracking, pseudo-scattering); weâ€™ll call it Woodcock tracking in effort to promote original paper.

can support procedural volumes and any type of lighting
\subsection{Unbiased methods}
Plus and cons - very slow no caching recomputation of visibility factor
