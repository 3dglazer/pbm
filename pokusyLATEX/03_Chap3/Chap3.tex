\chapter{Common solutions}
In this chapter we will try to summarize the most common technics for solving the rendering equation in the presence of participating media.

\section{ Rasterization}
Films - 

krakatoa rendering engine
nvidia smoke particles demo
pixar deep shadow maps

Still most used in films and games - fast approximation.
Particle rasterization + rendering slices of 3D volumes can solve only direct illumination.
\section{Raytracing}
pbrt single scattering
can support procedural volumes and any type of lighting
\subsection{Unbiased methods}
Plus and cons - very slow no caching recomputation of visibility factor
\subsection{Biased methods}
irradiance caching, Photon tracing, final gather ...
Plus and cons
